# Regret-Minimization-with-GANs
Implementation of Regret Minimization in Generative Adversarial Networks to improve convergence rate to reach an equilibrium.

-> Go through the entire report for understanding what are Generative Adversarial Networks and what is Regret Minimizaton. 
<br>
-> My approach for implementation is based on the referenced research paper. Read first 5 pages of that paper for getting more clarity about Regret Minimization and my implementation.
<br>
-> MNIST dataset is used for the test purpose. Running 'GAN_Regret_Minimization.py' file will automatically download the dataset.
<br>
-> Running this python file may take 10 minutes to train GANs for 100 epochs.
<br>
-> Google's Tensorflow framework is used for the implementation.
<br>
-> To change window size change 'w' variable in the code.
<br>
-> Refer to results shown in Report to see the outcome/inferences drawn by this project.
